# Welcome to the MerBot Wiki

### Description

Derived from the InMoov project by Gael Langevin, which has hugely benefitted from the project’s open source nature, MerBot is a 3D printed robot that is currently being constructed by undergraduate students at Mercer University. It is a focal point for developing more advanced robotics and further accessibility to the masses.

### Goals

The following are current to-be features that are under consideration during MerBot’s present construction.

* Create further documentation on MerBot’s progress.
* Include integration of Vision Language Action (VLA) machine learning models.
* Implement integration with the Issac ROS framework.
* Provide ability for MerBot to self train  by utilizing different specialized computing units.
